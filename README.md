# FramelessHelper 2.0

## Highlights compared to 1.x

- Windows: Gained the ability to only remove the title bar but preserve the window frame at the same time.
- Windows: The flicker and jitter during window resizing is mostly gone. It will completely gone when DPI is 96.
- Windows: The system menu will be opened if you right-click on your custom title bar.
- Windows: Replaced Qt's original system menu with FramelessHelper's homemade one, which looks a lot better than the original one.
- Linux: Removed the limitation of the Qt version. The minimum supported version is Qt 5.6 now (previously was 5.15).
- macOS: Removed the limitation of the Qt version. The minimum supported version is Qt 5.6 now (previously was 5.15).
- macOS: The frameless window now supports native resizing.
- Common: Almost completely rewritten of the whole library, it's now a lot more easier to setup your own custom title bar than before.
- Common: Added many more helper functions to allow creating your own custom window easier.
- Misc: Reorganized the project structure to be more like a modern library, it's now a lot more friendly to the library users.
- Misc: Many bugs from the 1.x times are fixed (they were not fixable in 1.x due to technical reasons).
